    <art id="introduction">
        <p>This is the part of every recipe blog that takes up too much space by telling you all about the author's life.</p>
        <p>I understand, I was an English Major too. I miss being able to creatively write, 
            and I'm jealous that you're getting to write and presumeably making ad revenue while doing it
            but I just came for the recipe. I'm craving cookies and I don't have time to learn about how this recipe
            saved you from bankruptcy, cured your grey hairs, and rescued your cat. But, nonetheless, I'm adding some text here, so I can fit in with
            all the other recipe blogs. Peer pressure I guess.</p>

            <p>I don't have anything profound to say about this recipe, other than it's SIMPLY the best 
                chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. It's nutty, rich, indulgent, and most importantly, managable on a late, tired night when all I want is something to satisfy my sweet tooth

                <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>

            </ul>

    <h3 class="title">How To</h3>
    <art id="Instructions">
       <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees</li>
            <li>Melt 9 tablespoons (1 stick + 1 tablespoon) butter in cast iron skillet
                . Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until butter is dark golden brown, has nutty aroma, and bubbling subsides, about 5 minutes; transfer to large bowl. 
                Stir remaining 3 tablespoons butter into hot butter until completely melted.
                <p class="aside">It's hard to tell how brown the butter is when it's in the skillet - spoon a drop onto a saucer and check the color occasionally </p></li>
            <li>Whisk brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, and salt into melted butter until smooth. Whisk in egg and yolk until smooth, about 30 seconds. Let mixture sit for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. 
                Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny.
                <p class="aside">30 seconds of straight whisking is way, way longer than you think it is. Your shoulder will be angry, and you'll wish you lifted weights more regularly.
                Or maybe that's just me...</p>
                <p class="aside">This step, and waiting between whisking feels weird. Trust the process though.</p></li>
            <li>Whisk flour and baking soda together in separate bowl, then stir flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined, 
                about 1 minute. 
                Stir in chocolate chips, making sure no flour pockets remain.</li>
            <li>Wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Transfer dough to now-empty skillet and press into even layer with spatula. 
                Transfer skillet to oven and bake until cookie is golden brown and edges are set, about 20 minutes, 
                rotating skillet halfway through baking. 
                Using potholders, transfer skillet to wire rack and let cookie cool for 30 minutes.
                <p class="aside">One very important note: Put a towel or something over the handle while it the cookie cools. 
                    Otherwise, you're liable to grab the 400 degree skillet and try to move it to another spot, and you will deeply, deeply regret it.
                    Ask me how I know</p> </li>
            <li>Slice cookie into wedges and serve. 
                <p class="aside">Maybe sprinkle just a teensy bit of course salt on top. Just try it.</p></li>
